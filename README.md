# agents-radar

A GitHub Actions workflow that runs every morning at 08:00 CST. It tracks GitHub activity from AI CLI tools, OpenClaw and its peer projects in the AI agent ecosystem, and scrapes official news and research from Anthropic and OpenAI, then publishes Chinese-language daily digests as GitHub Issues and committed Markdown files.

## Tracked sources

### AI CLI tools (GitHub)

| Tool | Repository |
|------|-----------|
| Claude Code | [anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) |
| OpenAI Codex | [openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) |
| Gemini CLI | [google-gemini/gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) |
| Kimi Code CLI | [MoonshotAI/kimi-cli](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/kimi-cli) |
| OpenCode | [anomalyco/opencode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) |
| Qwen Code | [QwenLM/qwen-code](https://github.com/QwenLM/qwen-code) |

### Claude Code Skills (GitHub)

| Source | Repository |
|--------|-----------|
| Claude Code Skills | [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) |

PRs and issues are fetched without a date filter and sorted by popularity (comment count), so the report always reflects the most actively discussed skills — not just the newest.

### OpenClaw + AI agent ecosystem (GitHub)

OpenClaw is tracked as the primary reference project. Nine peer projects in the personal AI assistant / autonomous agent space are tracked alongside it for cross-ecosystem comparison.

| Project | Repository | Stars |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| OpenClaw | [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) | — |
| Zeroclaw | [zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw](https://github.com/zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw) | 19.6k |
| EasyClaw | [gaoyangz77/easyclaw](https://github.com/gaoyangz77/easyclaw) | 87 |
| LobsterAI | [netease-youdao/LobsterAI](https://github.com/netease-youdao/LobsterAI) | 2.6k |
| ZeptoClaw | [qhkm/zeptoclaw](https://github.com/qhkm/zeptoclaw) | 372 |
| NanoBot | [HKUDS/nanobot](https://github.com/HKUDS/nanobot) | 25.5k |
| PicoClaw | [sipeed/picoclaw](https://github.com/sipeed/picoclaw) | 20.2k |
| NanoClaw | [qwibitai/nanoclaw](https://github.com/qwibitai/nanoclaw) | 15k |
| IronClaw | [nearai/ironclaw](https://github.com/nearai/ironclaw) | 3.5k |
| TinyClaw | [TinyAGI/tinyclaw](https://github.com/TinyAGI/tinyclaw) | 2.7k |

### Official web content (sitemap-based)

| Organization | Site | Tracked sections |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic | [anthropic.com](https://www.anthropic.com) | `/news/`, `/research/`, `/engineering/`, `/learn/` |
| OpenAI | [openai.com](https://openai.com) | research, publication, release, company, engineering, milestone, learn-guides, safety, product |

New articles are detected by comparing sitemap `lastmod` timestamps against a persisted state file (`digests/web-state.json`). On the **first run**, up to 25 recent articles per site are fetched and a comprehensive overview report is generated. On subsequent runs, only new or updated URLs trigger a report; if nothing changed, the web report step is skipped entirely.

## Features

- Fetches issues, pull requests, and releases updated in the last 24 hours across all tracked repos
- Tracks trending Claude Code Skills — sorted by community engagement, not recency
- Generates a per-tool summary for each CLI repository and a cross-tool comparative analysis
- Generates a deep OpenClaw project report plus a cross-ecosystem comparison against 9 peer projects
- Scrapes official Anthropic and OpenAI web content via sitemaps; detects new articles incrementally
- Publishes GitHub Issues for each report type; commits Markdown files to `digests/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Runs on a daily schedule via GitHub Actions; supports manual triggering

## Setup

### 1. Fork this repository

### 2. Add Secrets

Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and add:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API key — works with both Anthropic and Kimi Code |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | API endpoint override. Set to `https://api.kimi.com/coding/` for Kimi Code; leave unset for Anthropic |

> `GITHUB_TOKEN` is provided automatically by GitHub Actions.

### 3. Enable the workflow

Confirm the workflow is enabled in the **Actions** tab.

To test immediately, go to **Actions → Daily Agents Radar → Run workflow**.

> **First run note**: The web content step will fetch up to 50 articles (25 per site) and may take a few extra minutes. Subsequent runs are fast — only new articles are processed.

## Running locally

```bash
pnpm install

export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxx
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.kimi.com/coding/
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-kimi-xxxxxxxx
export DIGEST_REPO=your-username/agents-radar  # optional; omit to only write files

pnpm start
```

## Output format

Files are written to `digests/YYYY-MM-DD/`:

| File | Content | GitHub Issue label |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| `ai-cli.md` | CLI digest — cross-tool comparison + per-tool details | `digest` |
| `ai-agents.md` | OpenClaw deep report + cross-ecosystem comparison + 9 peer details | `openclaw` |
| `ai-web.md` | Official web content report (only written when new content exists) | `web` |

A shared state file `digests/web-state.json` tracks which web URLs have been seen; it is committed alongside the daily digests.
